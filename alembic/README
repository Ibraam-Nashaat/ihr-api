## Alembic Directory

The `/alembic` folder and its contents were automatically created by running:

```bash
alembic init alembic
```
This directory contains all the configuration and script files necessary to manage the projectâ€™s database schema migrations.

### What's Inside the `/alembic` Directory

* **`env.py`**
  The core configuration file for Alembic. It sets up the database connection, imports the models, and controls how migrations are run.

* **`script.py.mako`**
  A Mako template used to generate new migration files. When you run commands like  `alembic revision --autogenerate`, Alembic uses this template to structure the migration script.

* **`versions/`**
  A folder that stores all versioned migration scripts. Each file here represents a change to your database schema and includes both upgrade and downgrade instructions.

### About `script.py.mako`

The `script.py.mako` file is a template that defines the default structure of migration scripts. It contains placeholders that Alembic fills in during script generation.

It typically includes:

* `revision`: A unique ID for the migration.
* `down_revision`: The ID of the previous migration, ensuring migration order is preserved.
* `upgrade()`: A function where changes to the schema are defined.
* `downgrade()`: A function to undo those changes if needed.

Alembic uses this template to maintain consistency and structure across all migration scripts.
